# notes
Hello, I am a high school student from Turkey with a love for math, and this year I have decided to typeset my notes in LaTeX, as opposed to before where I was using Notion. (some fearmongering from my friend about Notion being proprietary software was enough to convince me)  
These notes are typeset in English, using Evan Chen's LaTeX style file `evan.sty`. You can find this file [here](https://github.com/vEnhance/dotfiles/blob/main/texmf/tex/latex/evan/evan.sty). Check Evan out since he's one of my main motivations behind studying math in the first place.  
Do not distribute these notes since the underlying books and study materials are more than likely protected by some kind of license or copyright.
